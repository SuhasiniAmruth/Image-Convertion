 Write a program to print 'Hello World'.
Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 96.25). You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking or bad user data.
Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Pay the hourly rate for the hours up to 40 and 1.5 times the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75).Do not worry about error checking the user input - assume the user types numbers properly.
Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
Score Grade
      >= 0.9 A 
      >= 0.8 B 
      >= 0.7 C
      >= 0.6 D
      < 0.6 F
If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit. For the test, enter a score of 0.85.
Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Pay should be the normal rate for hours up to 40 and time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. Put the logic to do the computation of pay in a function called computepay() and use the function to do the computation. The function should return a value. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75).Do not worry about error checking the user input unless you want to - you can assume the user types numbers properly.
Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'. Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a valid number, catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the number. 
Write code using find() and string slicing to extract the number at the end of the line below. Convert the extracted value to a floating point number and print it out.	
X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475
Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, looking for lines of the form:
X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475
Count these lines and extract the floating point values from each of the lines and compute the average of those values and produce an output as shown below. Do not use the sum() function or a variable named sum in your solution. You can download the sample data at http://www.py4e.com/code3/mbox-short.txt.
When you are testing below enter mbox-short.txt as the file name.
Open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line, split the line into a list of words using the split() method. The program should build a list of words. For each word on each line check to see if the word is already in the list and if not append it to the list. When the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in alphabetical order. You can download the sample data at http://www.py4e.com/code3/romeo.txt
Open the file mbox-short.txt and read it line by line. When you find a line that starts with 'From ' like the following line:
From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008
You will parse the From line using split() and print out the second word in the line (i.e. the entire address of the person who sent the message). Then print out a count at the end.Hint: make sure not to include the lines that start with 'From:'. Also look at the last line of the sample output to see how to print the count.You can download the sample data at http://www.py4e.com/code3/mbox-short.txt
Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.
Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.
From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008
Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour.
Finding Numbers in a Haystack
In this assignment you will read through and parse a file with text and numbers. You will extract all the numbers in the file and compute the sum of the numbers.
Data Files
We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment.
Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/regex_sum_42.txt (There are 90 values with a sum=445833)
Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/regex_sum_1406588.txt (There are 91 values and the sum ends with 209)
These links open in a new window. Make sure to save the file into the same folder as you will be writing your Python program. Note: Each student will have a distinct data file for the assignment - so only use your own data file for analysis.
Data Format
The file contains much of the text from the introduction of the textbook except that random numbers are inserted throughout the text. Here is a sample of the output you might see:

The sum for the sample text above is 27486. The numbers can appear anywhere in the line. There can be any number of numbers in each line (including none).
Handling The Data
The basic outline of this problem is to read the file, look for integers using the re.findall(), looking for a regular expression of '[0-9]+' and then converting the extracted strings to integers and summing up the integers.
 
Exploring the HyperText Transport Protocol
You are to retrieve the following document using the HTTP protocol in a way that you can examine the HTTP Response headers.
http://data.pr4e.org/intro-short.txt
There are three ways that you might retrieve this web page and look at the response headers:
Preferred: Modify the socket1.py program to retrieve the above URL and print out the headers and data. Make sure to change the code to retrieve the above URL - the values are different for each URL.
Open the URL in a web browser with a developer console or FireBug and manually examine the headers that are returned.
Scraping Numbers from HTML using BeautifulSoup In this assignment you will write a Python program similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/urllink2.py. The program will use urllib to read the HTML from the data files below, and parse the data, extracting numbers and compute the sum of the numbers in the file.
We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment.
Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.html (Sum=2553)
Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_1406590.html (Sum ends with 76)
You do not need to save these files to your folder since your program will read the data directly from the URL. Note: Each student will have a distinct data url for the assignment - so only use your own data url for analysis.
Data Format
The file is a table of names and comment counts. You can ignore most of the data in the file except for lines like the following:

You are to find all the <span> tags in the file and pull out the numbers from the tag and sum the numbers.
Look at the sample code provided. It shows how to find all of a certain kind of tag, loop through the tags and extract the various aspects of the tags.

You need to adjust this code to look for span tags and pull out the text content of the span tag, convert them to integers and add them up to complete the assignment.
Sample Execution

Following Links in Python
In this assignment you will write a Python program that expands on http://www.py4e.com/code3/urllinks.py. The program will use urllib to read the HTML from the data files below, extract the href= vaues from the anchor tags, scan for a tag that is in a particular position relative to the first name in the list, follow that link and repeat the process a number of times and report the last name you find.
We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the name for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment
Sample problem: Start at http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Fikret.html
Find the link at position 3 (the first name is 1). Follow that link. Repeat this process 4 times. The answer is the last name that you retrieve.
Sequence of names: Fikret Montgomery Mhairade Butchi Anayah
Last name in sequence: Anayah
Actual problem: Start at: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Andrea.html
Find the link at position 18 (the first name is 1). Follow that link. Repeat this process 7 times. The answer is the last name that you retrieve.
Hint: The first character of the name of the last page that you will load is: D
Strategy
The web pages tweak the height between the links and hide the page after a few seconds to make it difficult for you to do the assignment without writing a Python program. But frankly with a little effort and patience you can overcome these attempts to make it a little harder to complete the assignment without writing a Python program. But that is not the point. The point is to write a clever Python program to solve the program.
Sample execution
Here is a sample execution of a solution:

The answer to the assignment for this execution is "Anayah".
Extracting Data from XML
In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/geoxml.py. The program will prompt for a URL, read the XML data from that URL using urllib and then parse and extract the comment counts from the XML data, compute the sum of the numbers in the file.
We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment.
Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.xml (Sum=2553)
Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_1406592.xml (Sum ends with 35)
You do not need to save these files to your folder since your program will read the data directly from the URL. Note: Each student will have a distinct data url for the assignment - so only use your own data url for analysis.
Data Format and Approach
The data consists of a number of names and comment counts in XML as follows:

You are to look through all the <comment> tags and find the <count> values sum the numbers. The closest sample code that shows how to parse XML is geoxml.py. But since the nesting of the elements in our data is different than the data we are parsing in that sample code you will have to make real changes to the code.
To make the code a little simpler, you can use an XPath selector string to look through the entire tree of XML for any tag named 'count' with the following line of code:

Take a look at the Python ElementTree documentation and look for the supported XPath syntax for details. You could also work from the top of the XML down to the comments node and then loop through the child nodes of the comments node.
Sample Execution

Extracting Data from JSON
In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/json2.py. The program will prompt for a URL, read the JSON data from that URL using urllib and then parse and extract the comment counts from the JSON data, compute the sum of the numbers in the file and enter the sum below:
We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment.
Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.json (Sum=2553)
Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_1406593.json (Sum ends with 1)
You do not need to save these files to your folder since your program will read the data directly from the URL. Note: Each student will have a distinct data url for the assignment - so only use your own data url for analysis.
Data Format
The data consists of a number of names and comment counts in JSON as follows:

The closest sample code that shows how to parse JSON and extract a list is json2.py. You might also want to look at geoxml.py to see how to prompt for a URL and retrieve data from a URL.
Sample Execution

Calling a JSON API
In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/geojson.py. The program will prompt for a location, contact a web service and retrieve JSON for the web service and parse that data, and retrieve the first place_id from the JSON. A place ID is a textual identifier that uniquely identifies a place as within Google Maps.
API End Points
To complete this assignment, you should use this API endpoint that has a static subset of the Google Data:

This API uses the same parameter (address) as the Google API. This API also has no rate limit so you can test as often as you like. If you visit the URL with no parameters, you get "No address..." response.
To call the API, you need to include a key= parameter and provide the address that you are requesting as the address= parameter that is properly URL encoded using the urllib.parse.urlencode() function as shown in http://www.py4e.com/code3/geojson.py
Make sure to check that your code is using the API endpoint is as shown above. You will get different results from the geojson and json endpoints so make sure you are using the same end point as this autograder is using.
Test Data / Sample Execution
You can test to see if your program is working with a location of "South Federal University" which will have a place_id of "ChIJNeHD4p-540AR2Q0_ZjwmKJ8".

Single Table SQL
If you don't already have it, install the SQLite Browser from http://sqlitebrowser.org/.
Then, create a SQLITE database or use an existing database and create a table in the database called "Ages":

Then make sure the table is empty by deleting any rows that you previously inserted, and insert these rows and only these rows with the following commands:

Once the inserts are done, run the following SQL command:

Find the first row in the resulting record set and enter the long string that looks like 53656C696E613333.
Note: This assignment must be done using SQLite - in particular, the SELECT query above will not work in any other database. So you cannot use MySQL or Oracle for this assignment.
Counting Email in Database
This application will read the mailbox data (mbox.txt) and count the number of email messages per organization (i.e. domain name of the email address) using a database with the following schema to maintain the counts.

When you have run the program on mbox.txt upload the resulting database file above for grading.
If you run the program multiple times in testing or with dfferent files, make sure to empty out the data before each run.
You can use this code as a starting point for your application: http://www.py4e.com/code3/emaildb.py.
The data file for this application is the same as in previous assignments: http://www.py4e.com/code3/mbox.txt.
Because the sample code is using an UPDATE statement and committing the results to the database as each record is read in the loop, it might take as long as a few minutes to process all the data. The commit insists on completely writing all the data to disk every time it is called.
The program can be speeded up greatly by moving the commit operation outside of the loop. In any database program, there is a balance between the number of operations you execute between commits and the importance of not losing the results of operations that have not yet been committed.
Musical Track Database
This application will read an iTunes export file in XML and produce a properly normalized database with this structure:

If you run the program multiple times in testing or with different files, make sure to empty out the data before each run.
You can use this code as a starting point for your application: http://www.py4e.com/code3/tracks.zip. The ZIP file contains the Library.xml file to be used for this assignment. You can export your own tracks from iTunes and create a database, but for the database that you turn in for this assignment, only use the Library.xml data that is provided.
To grade this assignment, the program will run a query like this on your uploaded database and look for the data it expects to see:

The expected result of the modified query on your database is: (shown here as a simple HTML table with titles)

Many Students in Many Courses
This application will read roster data in JSON format, parse the file, and then produce an SQLite database that contains a User, Course, and Member table and populate the tables from the data file.
You can base your solution on this code: http://www.py4e.com/code3/roster/roster.py - this code is incomplete as you need to modify the program to store the role column in the Member table to complete the assignment.
Each student gets their own file for the assignment. Download this file and save it as roster_data.json. Move the downloaded file into the same folder as your roster.py program.
Once you have made the necessary changes to the program and it has been run successfully reading the above JSON data, run the following SQL command:

The output should look as follows:

Once that query gives the correct data, run this query:

You should get one row with a string that looks like XYZZY53656C696E613333.
